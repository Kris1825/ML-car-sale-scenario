# Car Purchase Prediction using ANN

## 📌 Project Overview
This project predicts the **Car Purchase Amount** customers are willing to pay, based on demographic and financial attributes such as:
- Age
- Annual Salary
- Credit Card Debt
- Net Worth
- Country & Gender

The dataset is provided in CSV format.

## 🧠 Approach
- Data cleaning & preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with matplotlib & seaborn
- Feature encoding (for categorical variables)
- Normalization of numerical features
- Building an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) with Keras/TensorFlow
- Model evaluation (MSE, RMSE, R²)

## 🚀 Results
- Final model achieved **R² = 0.XX**
- Visualization of predictions vs actual values
